    description: `
      At Dericon GmbH, my latest project involves developing a responsive, intuitive workflow editor featuring a specialized view that displays tasks from the backend as a graph. The UI converts tasks into nodes and edges, and an auto-layout function optimizes their positions. Additionally, the project incorporates dynamic form generation based on backend-provided structures.

      This web application presents an interactive questionnaire featuring a variety of categories. Each category contains a finite number of questions accompanied by their respective answers. The questionnaire supports both standard and multiple-choice questions. Upon completing each category, the user is prompted to decide whether they wish to proceed with any remaining categories. All responses are stored and ultimately transmitted to a backend service for further analysis. I designed this tool to cater to the requirements of a friend who operates a financial consulting website, <a href="https://andreasjansen.com/">andreasjansen.com</a>.

      The Nextflow pipeline employs Nextflow to process data by monitoring a designated folder for incoming fastq files. These files are subsequently aligned to a reference sequence using <a href="https://github.com/lh3/minimap2">minimap2</a>. The results from various files are collected, combined, and then passed to the variant caller, <a href="https://github.com/kishwarshafin/pepper">PEPPER-Margin-DeepVariant</a>, which generates the final VCF outcome.
